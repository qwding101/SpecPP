# SpecPP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package performs spectral analysis of multivariate spatial point
patterns observed in a rectangular region ([Ding et al.,
2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09948)). By specifying a parametric
model for the intensity, it extracts the frequency‚Äêdomain
characteristics of your data by smoothing the periodogram. Key features
of this tool include spectral density estimation, cross-validated
bandwidth selection, spectrum visualization, and coherence analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SpecPP from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("qwding101/SpecPP")
```

## FAQ

#### **Q:** What is a *(spatial) point pattern*?

*Spatial point pattern* is a collection of locations of some event
(observations) of interest on the space, such as
[earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-89.1006,-517.5&extent=89.1006,66.09375&range=month&magnitude=4.5&baseLayer=terrain&settings=true),
[crimes](https://www.crimemapping.com/map/agency/98), [disease
outbreaks](https://www.healthmap.org/en/), [traffic
accidents](http://www2.wagmap.jp/jikomap/APIDetail/Gate?API=1&linkid=7ca308ba-e675-436a-a50c-320662f5ff78&mid=1),
[rental housing spots](https://www.homes.co.jp/chintai/tokyo/map/), and
[geotagged

A point pattern is *multivariate* if each event belongs to one of the
finite set of categories. For an introduction to point pattern analysis,
please refer to [link

or [link

#### **Q:** What is the main advantage or unique contribution of SpecPP?

Traditional tools for point pattern analysis (in both spatial and
frequency domains) often rely on the assumption of homogeneity, which is
stringent for applications. Point pattern data in real life usually
exhibits inhomogeneous behavior, that is, the locations of events are
not scattered uniformly in space. In this package, we developed a
frequency-domain method for analyzing inhomogeneous point patterns,
which extends spectral techniques to multivariate and nonstationary
settings. It also provides computational advantages, especially when
there is a large number or type of events in the data.

#### **Q:** How to use SpecPP?

[This
tutorial](https://qwding101.github.io/SpecPP/articles/lansing.html)
demonstrates how to use SpecPP to analyze multivariate point pattern
data.
