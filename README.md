# SpecPP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package performs spectral analysis of multivariate spatial point
patterns observed in a rectangular region ([Ding et al.,
2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09948)). By specifying a parametric
model for the intensity, it extracts the frequency‚Äêdomain
characteristics of your data by smoothing the periodogram. Key features
of this tool include spectral density estimation, cross-validated
bandwidth selection, spectrum visualization, and coherence analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SpecPP from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("qwding101/SpecPP")
```

## Tutorial

[This
tutorial](https://qwding101.github.io/SpecPP/articles/lansing.html)
demonstrates how to use SpecPP to analyze multivariate point pattern
data.
